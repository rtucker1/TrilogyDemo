## Activity File: C2 Research

In this activity you will research various C2 frameworks using the [C2 Matrix](https://www.thec2matrix.com/matrix) in order to determine which frameworks may suit your engagement best.

### Scenario

You have hired as a penetration tester at a consulting agency and have been assigned to an upcoming assignment. As part of this assignment, you have been tasked with coming up with a primary, secondary, and tertiary C2 framework to use in an upcoming engagement. 

The client has shared a few important details for your consideration:

- Their network is mostly Windows machines, with some Linux machines scattered throughout.

- Their firewall rules only allow ports 80,443 TCP and port 53 UDP outbound.

As part of your company's policies, there's a few additional requirements:

- The C2 framework must support logging

- It must support multiple users

- The framework must have a full version released, i.e. the version must be 1.0 or higher. No "beta" or "PoC" versions allowed.


Note: It's OK to have your primary C2 not support all operating systems, as long as the secondary or tertiary supports them.


### Instructions 

Using the help of the C2 matrix and Google, find three different C2 frameworks that fit your operational needs. For each framework you've identified as a good candidate, answer the following questions

1. What is the name of the C2 framework?

2. What operating systems do its agents support?

3. What channels can the agents communicate over?

4. What language is it written in?

5. Is it open or closed source?

6. Does the developer have a Slack or Twitter link for potential support questions?
